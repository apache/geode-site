# Apache Geode Site

This repository contains the source files for the [Apache Geode website](https://geode.apache.org). 

The repository contains two branches:

- The __master__ branch contains the site's HTML framework, composed of the top-level landing page and the next level of pages, such as Docs, Community, and Releases, and the tools needed to compile the deployable site. 

  Content resides under the `website/content` directory. These sources are compiled into a deployable site by gradle scripts using a tool called [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc).

- The __asf-site__ branch contains a copy of the deployable site built from the __master__ branch, fleshed-out with __externally-generated__ content, which includes all non-framework content such as the User Guide and the Javadocs, which you build separately then add manually on the __asf-site__ branch before publishing the completed site. Stylesheets also reside on the __asf-site__ branch.

  To deploy the Apache Geode website, you push the __asf-site__ branch to the upstream Apache repository. An Apache "sync" tool monitors the __asf-site__ branch 
of the repository and publishes your update to the
[Geode website](http://geode.apache.org) after a 5-10 minute delay.


# Update procedure
Updating the website is a two-part process:

1. On the __master__ branch, update the website's framework pages.

1. Check out the __asf-site__ branch and add externally-generated content, such as the User Guide and the Javadocs.

When the site's updated framework has been fleshed-out with external content, the site is ready to be deployed.

## Prerequisites

To generate the site locally, you need to install java and docker. 

Other support tools you may need include:

- pandoc
- nanoc

## Update the website framework

On the __master__ branch, update the website's framework pages. For a general release, this would likely include:

  - {geode-site}/website/content/index.html
  - {geode-site}/website/content/community/index.html
  - {geode-site}/website/content/docs/index.html
  - {geode-site}/website/content/releases/index.html

A couple of notes specific to documentation:

  - The Geode website is not equipped to understand the `redirects.rb` substitutions provided with the Geode and Geode Native user guides. On this site, the file `website/content/.htaccess` provides redirect information. Edit this file on the __master__ branch, and the `gradlew publish` operation will propagate your changes to the __asf-site__ branch.
  - If you need to change the layout or styling of the site, then you will probably need to change
an HTML, JS or CSS file on the __asf-site__ branch.


## Locally generate the site framework and review your changes

You should still be on the __master__ branch. 

1. Generate the site content by navigating to the top level directory of the `geode-site` repo and using gradle to compile the sources into a deployable site framework:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew compile
    ```

  You may need to suppress rat checking: add `-x rat` to the end of the `.gradlew` command.

2. View the generated site by running:

    ```
    $ ./gradlew view
    ```
    
  and point your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to view the result. 

  You may need to suppress rat checking: add `-x rat` to the end of the `.gradlew` command.

3. To make further changes, stop the build (Ctrl-C), edit files, recompile, and view again.

4. Once you are happy with your changes, commit them to the __master__ branch and push them to the upstream Apache repository.

## Add externally-generated content to the site framework

### 1. On the __master__ branch, run the gradle command:

    $ ./gradlew publish

  The gradle `publish` target:

  - Checks out the __asf-site__ branch, and
  - Copies the website files to their deployment directories.

**HEADS-UP**
The `gradlew publish` command *does not* update the `css` and `stylesheets` directories. If you made format changes there, you must manually merge the new versions of those files from the __master__ branch.

  - While still on the __master__ branch, save those files to a location outside the geode-site repo.
  - After running the `gradlew publish` command, copy the new versions to the appropriate directories in the __asf-site__ branch.


### 2. Add a new user guide

1. Create a local build of the User Guide as described in `{geode-project-dir}/geode-book/README.md`. 

1. Copy the User Guide to the `geode-site` repo:

  1. On the __asf-site__ branch, create a destination directory for the User Guide. The naming convention is:

        ```
        {geode-site}/docs/guide/XY
        ```
  where `XY` is the product version of your documentation (e.g., `{geode-site}/website/content/docs/guide/17` if you are publishing the documentation for Apache Geode 1.7). So, if your current working directory is the top level of `{geode-site}`, you would create the destination directory with the following command:

        ```
        $ mkdir -p {geode-site}/docs/guide/XY
        ```

  1. Navigate to the User Guide you have built in the Geode repository: `{geode-project-dir}/geode-book/final_app/public/docs/guide/XY`.

  1. Use `tar` to copy the directory in order to preserve links and other filesystem niceties.

  - Create the tarfile in your Desktop for easy access on the retrieval side.

        ```
        $ tar cvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar .
        ```

  - Navigate to the target directory and un-tar the userguide archive:

        ```
        $ cd {geode-site}/docs/guide/XY
        $ tar xvf ~/Desktop/new-guide-content.tar
        ```

### 3. Publish new javadocs

You should still be on the __asf-site__ branch. Copy new javadocs directly to the directory
`{geode-site}/releases/latest/javadoc/`.

The new javadocs _replace_ those currently within the directory.

## Deploy the update
Commit and push the __asf-site__ branch. Apache detects the update and publishes it. The site should update in 5-10 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

- If the site does not update in 5-10 minutes, __push a new commit by adding or subtracting a blank line in the top-level `index.html` file.__ This usually does the trick.

- Check your commit of the __asf-site__ branch. The site's deployable files are at the top level, rooted at {geode-site}/index.html. Make sure that directories such as `{geode-site}/docs` and `{geode-site}/releases` contain the latest versions of `index.html` and the docs.

- DO NOT commit the {geode-site}/build directory. This is the place where files compiled on the __master__ branch are placed, then retrieved after the switch to the __asf-site__ branch. It must be freshly generated with each iteration, not saved to the repo.
